                    <h1>My First Berkshire ABC</h1>
                    <p>Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc invests in dozens of businesses, and a new book tries to explain it all to young readers, from A to Z. Two Omaha residents, author Nancy Rips and illustrator Tom Kerr, have teamed up on “My First Berkshire ABC” to teach children about one of the world’s best-known companies, and a little about the local billionaire behind it.</p>
                    <p className="paddingTop">More than 1,000 copies were sold at Berkshire’s annual meeting, which draws thousands of people to Omaha and where Buffett has a say on what gets sold.</p>

                <p>“You need something to bring home to your kids and grandkids to explain Berkshire,” Rips, who has also written three books about Jewish holidays, said in a joint interview with Kerr.</p>
                <p className="paddingTop">Kerr has worked at many newspapers and drew McGruff, the Crime Dog for the National Crime Prevention Council.</p>
                <p className="paddingTop">“Part of what Warren talks about is investing in things that you know” he said. “Virtually everything in here is something that somebody can relate to and touch and understand.”</p>
